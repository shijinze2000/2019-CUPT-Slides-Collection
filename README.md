# 2019-CUPT-Slides-Collection
# This repository categorizes slides from my work cases of the competition: 2019 CUPT
# The slides include 4 problems.
# P4: A light ball (e.g. ping-pong ball) can be picked up with a funnel by blowing air through it. Explain the phenomenon and investigate the relevant parameters.
# P5: When a vertical water jet enters a bottle, sound may be produced, and, as the bottle is filled up, the properties of the sound may change. Investigate how relevant parameters of the system such as speed and dimensions of the jet, size and shape of the bottle or water temperature affect the sound.
# P12: A spinning gyroscope made from a conducting, but non-ferromagnetic material slows down when placed in a magnetic field. Investigate how the deceleration depends on relevant parameters.
# P17: Wooden popsicle sticks can be joined together by slightly bending each of them so that they interlock in a so-called “cobra weave” chain. When such a chain has one of its ends released, the sticks rapidly dislodge, and a wave front travels along the chain. Investigate the phenomenon.
